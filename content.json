They generally consists of a specially trained billing coder compiling a list of services based on your various interactions with your doctor. The whole process can be quite subjective and unfortunately you typically won’t have a clue what the costs are, or how to compare and baseline with other practices until after the whole ordeal is over. So how do different practices stack up in terms of healthcare costs? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid provide data sets for several providers which include average submitted charges and services rendered for various condition. We thought it would be interesting to plot in an interactive bubble chart to explore the costs, using a Level 1 Excision/Biopsy as an example, and the visualizations were quite alarming. Some healthcare providers charge over $15,000 on average, where others are charging less than $100. You can explore the interactive bubble chart by scrolling over the bubbles or click Select States to get a sense of how much costs can vary within a few example states. Why does the Cost of a Biopsy Differ So Much from Practice to Practice?We don’t know for certain. Each provider tends to charge for services in their own ways. Some facilities run with a lot more overhead than necessary for your procedure. What Medicare and Your Insurance PaysWhat’s even more Bizarre about medical billing is that Medicare has already decided what they will pay for these services. For the example above it’s generally about $200 to $400. In many instances it’s far less than the bill that the practitioner provides, in which case the practitioner eats the cost. In some even stranger cases it’s more than the practitioner charges, and the practitioner gets a little extra. Similarly, insurance typically negotiates a price far less than what the provider bills, leaving the provider charges as meaningless as an MSRP at Marshalls. But what if you don’t have insurance, or you have a crappy high deductable plan? What you Need to KnowIf you’re lucky enough to have Medicare or a good insurance policy, you may never even see or know these charges exist. If you have no insurance, or a high deductable or consumer plan, you could be hit with a very high bill. More appalling, it may be a charge that’s extremely more expensive than the practice down the road. Even more appalling, you will be suckered into paying the full MSRP, where insurance and Medicare are paying only a fraction of that amount. If this were any other industry, we would recognize red flags all over these billing practices, but we are far too accepting of the healthcare system. We think it’s time for a change.

So What the Heck is Insurance Really?Medical insurance is sort of one step shy of a shady mob guy providing protection you can’t refuse. They skim a little out of your paycheck, go off and gamble with it in various investments, but ultimately provide some help should you ever encounter unfortunate health circumstances. How you feel about the whole relationship is for you to decide.Medical insurance is designed to be extremely confusing, but in all it simply boils down to splitting the cost of your medical expenses between yourself, the insurance company, often your employer, and sometimes the government. They do this in a mix of different and complicated healthcare plans that breakdown the expenses each in their own unique way. Some Things to Note FirstFirst off, there are a lot of overly complicated terms you should know when selecting an insurance. Here’s the breakdown if you don’t already know them: Premium:This is usually the insurance fee you will pay per paycheck, or maybe a monthly fee if you are self-employed. it’s the cyclical fee that you pay for your healthcare. Copay:In addition to your premium, a copay the cost you will pay each time you see a doctor. Insurance generally pays for some portion of your doctor visit, but wants you to pay for some portion as well, or else you could be at the doctor every week with any minor ache or pain. hence, they will co-pay with you for each of your visits. Deductible:Watch out for this one! Your insurance won’t pay anything until you’ve already paid the deductible amount. So if your deductible is $1000, your insurance really won’t pay anything until you first have at least paid $1000 in medical expenses, typically for the year. Some plans are only designed to help you when crap really hits the fan, but if you spend far less than the deductible on healthcare per year, you may feel cheated that after all those premiums you’ve paid, your health insurance still really covered none of your doctor visits. Max Out of Pocket:This is the total maximum amount you should have to personally pay for healthcare, typically per year. If you max out of pocket expenses is $3000, then once you have personally paid that much in healthcare expenses per year, your insurance should fully cover all of your remaining healthcare expenses for that year. This includes personal expenses before and after you’ve reached your deductible. This will really help if your health takes a major turn for the worse as you will only pay up to that amount per year. In or Out of Network:The network is really just an ambiguous group of doctors that the insurance has, sort of, partnered with. If you go to a doctor in the network, the insurance company feels confident enough to pay more for your visit and you will pay less. If you choose someone outside you will pay more, or maybe even all of the cost of the visit. I say ambiguous because it always seems very difficult to tell whether a doctor is in or out of the network. When in doubt, call that number on your insurance card and double check, which brings us to the next important section. Whenever In Doubt, Call Your InsuranceAnnoy or become BFFs with your insurance customer service reps. I cannot emphasize this enough as it can save you money! If you are not sure that the doctor, urgent care, or hospital facility is covered, call and double check with these guys. Make sure you hear from the horse’s mouth how much they will cover. Never trust the healthcare plan or system to work right, and double check any bill that you receive. All too often, I have received bills stating what I owe, only to call and hear from the insurance that they should be paying this. Understanding Your QuotesWhen choosing your healthcare plan you will see a cost breakdown for the general categories of healthcare visits. Some will be a dollar value and others often a percentage. Some are self explanatory, but here’s the breakdown. Preventative Care:A general checkup. Hopefully this should be free for you. Out Patient:This is generally when you’re seeing a practice outside the hospital (e.g. doctor or lab visits). In Patient:This is generally for when you are in the hospital. Maternity:General costs of having a baby! Watch out as there may be special instructions here, like you must notify your insurance within a few months of pregnancy. Emergency Room:The cost of going to the emergency room, and it’s generally pricey, so if you think your condition is not an emergency, try an Urgent Care center instead. Urgent Care:Cost to go to an urgent care facility. Prescription Drugs:Cost of drugs. The Typical Healthcare OptionsMore Traditional Healthcare Plans:These are the standard, age old insurance options. HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)This is typically a more all inclusive plan. What’s great about them is that they’re typically lower in costs. General doctors, specialists, labs, hospitals, and pharmacies band together to try and reduce costs. What sucks about them is that sometimes it feels they reduce costs a little too much. They often won’t cover anything deemed cosmetic in nature, and they are extremely bureaucratic. In order to get the actual healthcare you need, you’ll need to wait for permission, from a primary care doctor and your insurance, and you’ll really only be able to see whoever they work with. You’ll basically sacrifice your time and freedom for a discount in price, which could both be critical when it comes to healthcare. PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)This is, in a way, the opposite of an HMO. You can see generally whoever you like! Go straight to the specialists and have coverage for generally much more. The catch - premiums are generally much more expensive. Also, be careful of knowing in vs. out of network , and which how high your deductible might be. Your cost could go from say 20% to 80% or more if out of network, and 100% if you haven’t hit your deductible. Consumer Healthcare Plans:We like consumer healthcare options as it let’s you decide more of what types of healthcare services you want to buy, and evaluate the value you are getting from them. Even better yet, the money is usually pre-tax so Uncle Sam won’t skim off your medical expenses! HRA (Health Reimbursement Arrangement)I personally like this option. it’s generally like a high deductible PPO with cheaper premiums. So what does that mean? You get to see who you want to see, and pay a reasonable monthly fee. Your insurance won’t really cover anything until you’ve paid a lot out of pocket, but what makes it all worth while is that your employer will reimburse a good chunk cash on your immediate healthcare expenses. Maybe around $500 for yourself, or $1500 for your family depending on the plan. So you’ll pay nothing for the first portion of your healthcare expenses for the year. My experience is that the process is all quite automated so reimbursements aren’t a painful process of forms or anything like a crappy appliance rebate. You’ll just pay nothing until you’ve reached the reimbursement amount and the insurance takes care of the reimbursement allocation. After that, you’ll pay for everything until you hit your deductible, but good news… the reimbursement amount counts toward your deductible. So if you run the numbers, even if you have the remaining high deductible, you’ll still probably pay about the same as if you choose a PPO with higher monthly premiums. This is a great choice if you don’t see a doctor often (e.g. 2 - 3 times a year). If you stay under the reimbursement amount for the year, you’ll pay nothing, and the money left over often rolls over to the next year! HSA (Health Savings Account)Another good consumer healthcare option. Very similar to the HRA, but instead of a reimbursement, your employer just gives you a certain dollar value per year and puts it into a savings account for you. It usually becomes a personal bank account for you that you will keep even after you leave the plan. Unused money rolls over and also collects interest! FSA (Flexible Spending Account)This is not really a healthcare plan but still deserves to be mentioned. it’s usually an added option with your healthcare plan. FSAs give you the option to allocate pre-taxed money from your paycheck for the yearly medical expenses. Sounds good but there’s a catch… If you don’t use the money by the end of the year, your employer will take it from you. That’s a sort of red flag that I’ve never been able to get over. If you think you can predict and manage your healthcare expenses for the year, this may be a good way to save a few tax dollars. For me, it’s not worth the headache. Closing ThoughtsUltimately the choice of healthcare is yours alone to decide, and be mindful that all plans are a little different and may not perfectly match this post. Also, regardless of what you choose, it’s good to know the costs of your visits, which is still strangely so non-transparent. So do ask your providers for quotes, and always question your insurance when it comes to weird bills! Thanks for reading and feel free to subscribe or follow us on social medias!
