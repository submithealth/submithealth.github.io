As our first post I thought I would share the overall goals and values of this blog. So, why we are here?We’re here to help in the search of healthcare that is: Cost effective Time effective Get’s you patched up Effectively! In short, we seek Effective Healthcare.For many of us here, our experience with the healthcare system can be summarized by: Lots of money spent Often no real resolve to healthcare issues Major takeaway… See a doctor only when symptoms include verge of death Our hope is that it does not have to be this way. And we get it, understandably there isn’t a magical solution to solve everyone’s discomfort at the moment, that is until we finally get that tricorder working. But until then, our hope is to find and share practical solutions for getting healthcare delivered more effectively. So stay tuned, and thank you for reading.
